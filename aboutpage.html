  <section class="content">
    <p><strong>Hello, I'm Jenny, currently pursuing a B.A. in European Culture and Society at Flensburg University. While my academic path may not align perfectly with my deepest interests, my journey took an unexpected turn when I returned from a transformative year in England in 2021.</p>
  
    <p>My true passion lies in the dynamic realms of Game Design, Web Development, and Graphic Design. Beyond my studies, I immerse myself in the world of creativity and technology, fueled by a genuine enthusiasm for bringing ideas to life through digital mediums.</p>

    <p>During moments of leisure, you'll often find me engrossed in captivating books, navigating virtual landscapes through gaming, or indulging in the spine-chilling allure of horror movies. Beyond the digital realm, I embrace the analog pleasures of culinary artistry, occasionally treating myself and others to my culinary creations. Additionally, I find joy in nurturing my collection of plants, fostering a green oasis that mirrors my appreciation for growth and creativity.</strong></p>
